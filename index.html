        I chose the "Dark Lavender" theme by t7yang. My command prompt is
        lavender, too, it was one of the first things that I did with it. The
        sense of ownership in being able to customize the color scheme of a

        I looked down at the board. "The <strong>point</strong> isn't to win?" I
        asked. "The <strong>point</strong>," <span>Bredon</span> said grandly,
        "is to <u>play</u> a <em>beautiful</em> game." He lifted his hands and
        shrugged, his face breaking into a beautific smile. "Why would I want to
        win anything other than a <em>beautiful</em> game?"
